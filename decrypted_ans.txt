This is the second assignment for our cryptography course in the Spring 2018 semester.
For this assignment, write your own implementation of the RSA cryptographic system in 
any programming language of your choice. But allow the user the freedom to choose their 
own bit-length for the prime numbers. Your system should also encrypt only single ASCII 
characters from text files without salting. The ciphertext should be an ASCII file that 
is a sequence of numbers separated by newlines. For the submission, please send this 
plaintext file back by email as a text file encrypted using your own RSA public keys. 
In the email, specify the RSA modulus and the RSA secret exponent required to decrypt 
the file. As a bonus, implement one of the faster known algorithms for factoring integers
that is known in the literature.
